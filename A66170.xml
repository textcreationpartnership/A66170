            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM very Glad to meet you again in Parliament, where I have an Opportunity of Thanking you for the great Supplies you have given Me for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this War; and I hope by your Advice and Aſſiſtance, which has never failed Me, to take ſuch Meaſures, as may be moſt proper for Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Our Common Intereſt againſt the exceſſive Power of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have great Reaſon to Rejoyce in the happy Victory, which, by the Bleſſing of God, We obtained at Sea: And I wiſh I could tell you that the Succeſs at Land had been anſwerable to it: I am ſure My own Subjects had ſo remarkable a part in both, that their Bravery and Courage muſt ever be remembred to their Honour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are Repairing their Loſſes at Sea with great Diligence, and do deſign to augment their Land Forces conſiderably againſt the next Campaign; which makes it abſolutely neceſſary for Our Safety, that at leaſt as great a Force be maintained at Sea and Land, as We had the laſt Year; And therefore I muſt ask of you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, a Supply ſutable to ſo great an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible how heavy this Charge is upon my People, and it extreamly afflicts Me, that 'tis not poſſible to be avoided without Expoſing. Our ſelves to inevitable Ruine and Deſtruction: The Inconvenience of ſending out of the Kingdom great Sums of Money for the Payment of the Troops abroad is indeed very Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and I ſo much wiſh it could be remedied, That if you can ſuggeſt to Me any Methods for the Support of them, which may leſſen this Inconvenience, I ſhall be ready to receive them with all the Satisfaction imaginable.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>None can deſire more then I do that a Deſcent ſhould be made into <hi>France,</hi> and therefore notwithſtanding the Diſappointment of that Deſign this laſt Summer, I intend to Attempt it the next Year with a much more Conſiderable Force; And ſo ſoon as I ſhall be Enabled, all poſſible Care and Application ſhall be uſed towards it.</p>
               <p>And upon this Occaſion I cannot omit taking Notice of that Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deliverance, which, by the good Providence of God, We recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the laſt Spring, to the Diſappointment and Confuſion of Our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Deſigns and Expectations: This has ſufficiently ſhewn Us how much We are expoſed to the Attempts of <hi>France,</hi> while that King is in a Condition to make them; Let Us therefore improve the Advantage, We have at this time, of being joyned with moſt of the Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> againſt ſo dangerous an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; In this ſurely all Men will agree, who have any Love for their Countrey, or any Zeal for Our Religion: I cannot therefore doubt but you will continue to Support Me in this War againſt the declar'd Enemy of this Nation, and that you will give as ſpeedy Diſpatch to the Affairs before you, as the Nature and Importance of them will admit; that Our Preparations may be timely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the Preſervation of all that is Dear and Valuable to Us.</p>
               <p>I am ſure I can have no Intereſt but what is yours; We have the ſame Religion to Defend, and you cannot be more concerned for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of your Liberties and Properties, then I am that you ſhould always remain in the full Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of them; for I have no Aim but to make you a happy People.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have never ſpared to Expoſe my own Perſon for the Good and Welfare of this Nation, and I am ſo ſenſible of your Good Affections to Me, that I ſhall continue to do ſo with great Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs upon all Occaſions, wherein I may contribute to the Honour and Advantage of <hi>England.</hi>
